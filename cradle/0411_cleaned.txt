// Note:
// - 94,96 commands may not actually be setting / comparing a value, GE editor talks of masking.
// - In particular 95 'unmasks' the same value, and there is no such thing as un-setting a byte.
// => Seems to make more sense to see these as flags?

// This script is relatively simple.
